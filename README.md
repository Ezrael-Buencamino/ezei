# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, achievements, projects, hobbies, and contact information. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It includes sections like "About Me", "Achievements", "Skills", "Projects & Activities", "Hobbies & Interests", and "Contact Information". The website features a clean and modern design with an interactive collapse effect for each section and a custom layout.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
- **Interactive Sections:** Each section (About Me, Achievements, Skills, etc.) can be toggled to show more details, using Bootstrap's collapse feature.
- **Personalized Styling:** The website uses a black and red color scheme with a programming font to give it a tech-savvy aesthetic.
- **Circular Profile Picture:** A profile picture is displayed at the top of the "About Me" section, with a circular shape.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The custom CSS file that contains all the styling rules for the website.
- Images (folder): The folder contains the profile image (`download.jfif`) used in the portfolio.
